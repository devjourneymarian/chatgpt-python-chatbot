# chatgpt-python-chatbot

chatgpt-python-chatbot is used as a template for further projects.

## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). You will need to install the following:
1. OpenAI SDK: To interact with OpenAI's models.
2. python-dotenv: For managing environment variables securely (e.g., your OpenAI API key).

Run the following commands to install these dependencies:

```bash
pip install openai
pip install python-dotenv
```
## Resources
I highly recommend using the [official OpenAI Python API library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) on Github.
